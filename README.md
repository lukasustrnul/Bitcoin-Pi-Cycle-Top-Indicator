# Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator Tool
Simple web app developed using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It allows user to enter estimate of future bitcoin price development and determine likelihood that bitcoin will hit new all-time-high(ATH)

Functional interactive tool can be found at [btc-pi-cycle-top-indicator.streamlit.app](https://btc-pi-cycle-top-indicator.streamlit.app/)

My motivation for developing this tool and other useful information can be found directly in the app. You can also check its content and get the idea of its functionality from following screenshots.
